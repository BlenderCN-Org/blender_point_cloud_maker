Point Cloud Maker is an addon for Blender <http://www.blender.org/>
to create simple clouds of points: these are mesh objects which consist only
of vertices, without connecting edges or faces. Rendering these with
halo materials can produce some interesting effects.

The user manual can be found, in HTML format, in the docs/ subdirectory.
Start with docs/index.html.
